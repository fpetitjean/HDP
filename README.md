# HDP
Accurate estimation of conditional categorical probability distributions using Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes 

This package offers an accurate parameter estimation technique for Bayesian Network classifiers. It uses a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process to estimate the parameters (using a collapsed Gibbs sampler). Note that the package is built in a generic way such that it can estimate any conditional probability distributions over categorical variables.

## Compiling and launching
After cloning the repo, launch the following commands.
```
ant
java -Xmx1g -cp "bin:lib/*:lib/commons-math3-3.6.1/*"  monash.ml.hdp.testing.Test2LevelsExampleHeartAttack
```
This will run a simple example with a small toy dataset and then learning the probability distribution.

### Dependencies
* [Apache Common Maths 3 - 3.6.1](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/)
* [MLTools](https://github.com/HerrmannM/MLTools)

### Getting a cross-platform jar
Simply entering `ant` creates a jar file that you can execute in most environments in dist/HDP.jar.

### Memory Consumption
You may want to allow the JVM to use more memory if you are working with large models.
Use the `Xmx` flag to increase the JVM memory. For example, `java -Xmx4g`.


## Using it for your own library
The code available at `src/monash/ml/hdp/testing/Test2LevelsExampleHeartAttack.java`
gives a good idea on how to plug your own code with this library. 
Basically, you have to create a dataset in the form of a matrix of integers (`int[N][M+1]`) where `N` is the number of samples, and `M` the number of covariates (or features). `+1` is because the first column gives the values of the target variable you want to get a conditional estimate over. A cell `data[i][j]` represents the value taken by sample `i` for feature `x_{j-1}`. `data[i][0]` represents the value taken for the target variable. Things are coded over integers because this code is for categorical distributions. 

```java
String [][]data = {
    {"yes","heavy","tall"},
    {"no","light","short"},
    ...
    {"yes","heavy","med"}
};

ProbabilityTree hdp = new ProbabilityTree();
//learns p(target|x)
hdp.addDataset(data);
//print the tree
System.out.println(hdp.printProbabilities());
```
